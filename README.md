# pandemic-simulation
This project is about simulating the spread of pandemic given certain factors such as the total population, the starting infected percentage, natural immunity rate. It simulates the spread for 100 days and displays the spread on a maplotlib plot.

Following are the factors which are taken into account (affecting the spread)

<ul>
  <li>Starting Population - Total population </li>
  <li>Starting Immunity - Number of people already immune to the disease</li>
  <li>Starting infectors - Number of people infected at day 0</li>
  <li>DaysContagious - Number of days a person stays contagiou</li>
  <li>locdownDay - The day at which lockdown is announced</li>
  <li>lockdownPercentage - Percentage of people who obey lockdown</li>
  <li>maskDay - The day at which mask is announced mandatory</li>
